<h1> Crabpocalypse </h1>

Crabpocalypse is a chaotic platformer–RPG where a notoriously lazy college student is thrown into the unlikeliest of hero roles: stopping an army of hyper-intelligent mutant crabs from taking over the world. What begins as a normal day quickly spirals into an over-the-top clash of claws, comedy, and impending doom.

The game blends fast platforming, light RPG progression, and absurd humor as you battle through waves of crustacean enemies, unlock upgrades, and chase down the source of the crab uprising. Whether you’re kicking crabs off ledges or pulling off last-second power-ups, Crabpocalypse is all about chaotic fun with just enough story to hold the world together.

<h1> About the Game </h1>

A mysterious surge of evolutionary energy has transformed ordinary beach crabs into ruthless, organized invaders. When the world needs a hero, it gets… you. Armed with stubbornness, questionable decision-making, and whatever weapons you can scavenge, you must fight your way across increasingly bizarre levels to prevent crustacean domination.

Face different crab types, discover strange upgrades, and survive escalating encounters as the stakes grow higher and the crabs get weirder. It’s messy. It’s frantic. It’s the Crabpocalypse.
